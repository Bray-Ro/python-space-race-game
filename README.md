# python-space-race-game
just something i've been doing and i am still updating it.
When running press the yellow square to move, you are the blue arrow and you are racing the red one. To download the version for python 2 download the python 2 branch and for python 3 download the master branch. For the python 3 version to work you must have python 3 installed and termcolor installed.
